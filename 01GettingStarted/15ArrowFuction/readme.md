<h1>Arrow Function</h1>

```
Arrow functions are one of the most
leading features released in the modern javascript. the arrow functions are defined by
the token ' => '
```
### Example
```
sayHello = () => {
    document.write("hello");
}
```

**NOTE** - the paranthesis `()` are left empty if the function is'nt accepting any parameters

---------------------------

##### Below is the implimentation of multiply two numbers with arrow and native functions

### Adding two no. with native functions
```
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

add(5,7);
```
output - 12

* The arrow function (shorthand) for Addition
  
```
    let add = (a, b) => a + b;
    add(5, 7);
```
output - 12;

The arrow functions are heavily used in React.js (framework of javascript).

Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.
